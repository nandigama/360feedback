# 360feedback
Simple tool for soliciting truly anonymous 360 feedback. This tool is differet from the rest of the world comercial tools in a simple way. This tool allows the participants to select attributes for the feedback seeker as opposed to providing free text and scale based feedback.

I built this one in 2011. Languishing in my personal disk from a long time. So, I would like to donate it to the world.
